		<summary>MAL Updater script for XBMC by kuroshi</summary>
		<description>XBMAL is a simple updater script for MAL, based on your XBMC library. Currently it only deals with watched and plan to watch shows, and marks shows that are completely watched as complete. It still has a long way to go.

Notice! In order to use this addon, you need to restart XBMC after installing.</description>
		<disclaimer>This is still very experimental. Don't blame me if it messes up XBMC, MAL, or kills your cat. Really. (Released under GPLv3)</disclaimer>
